Experiments:

--- PART I ---

    Surprisingly skeptic policy will not affect the duration, however the number of people of infected significantly
    increases;

    Width 10, height 20, home 80, ess 20, skp 0
    Simulation average days to recover 28, average infected people 73, with 100 times of repeats

    Width 10, height 20, home 0, ess 20, skp 80
    Simulation average days to recover 27, average infected people 95, with 100 times of repeats

--- PART II ---

    Again, the frequent fliers in this model will surprisingly decrease the duration, while mildly increases the number
    of infected people. Maybe the fliers are tend to randomly fly to some spots that there is no person nearby, which
    may not be the case in the reality;

    Width 10, height 20, home 0, ess 20, skp 80, fliers 0
    Simulation average days to recover 27, average infected people 95, with 100 times of repeats

    Width 10, height 20, home 0, ess 20, skp 70, fliers 10
    Simulation average days to recover 17, average infected people 97, with 100 times of repeats


--- PART III, IV ---

    Susceptible people, which have higher probability of infection and longer time to recover and will stay at home if they
    are sick, are added as the 7th argument. The results indicate that the duration will be 10% longer;

    Width 10, height 20, home 10, ess 10, skp 50, fliers 5, susceptible 10
    Simulation average days to recover 22, average infected people 80, with 100 times of repeats

    Width 10, height 20, home 10, ess 20, skp 50, fliers 5, susceptible 0
    Simulation average days to recover 19, average infected people 79, with 100 times of repeats


Reflection:

    Inheritance makes the whole project code more reusable and avoids redundancy;
    It seems RunSimulation can be reused in AnalyzeSimulation, we did not do that as it is required that AnalyzeSimulation
    should not have the print output in RunSimulation;
